 implemenred augmented reality experience on web with arjs

So an idea hit my head on how to take marketting or branding of a product/company to the next level !
Here comes the idea of Augmented Reality experience of the product.
The journey:
step 1: Scan a QR Code (this will take u to the server and ask for ur camera permission.)
step 2: Hold the camera on the same QR marker. 
step 3: enjoy AR experience.

this code works for both android and ios which took me a lot of efforts to troubleshoot both platforms.
so if you are using this code plz support and subscribe my band Zero Friction
